# Types

DB48X, [like HP RPL](#rich-data-types), supports a wide variety of data types.


## Integers

The DB48X version of RPL distinguishes between integer values, like `123`, and
[decimal values](#decimal-numbers), like `123.` Integer values are represented
internally in a compact and efficient format, saving memory and making
computations faster. All values between -127 and 127 can be stored in two bytes.
All values between -16383 and 16383 in three bytes.

Integers can be [as large as memory permits](#big-integers).


## Big integers

The DB48X version of RPL can perform computations on arbitrarily large integers,
limited only by available memory, enabling for example the exact computation of
`100!` and making it possible to address problems that require exact integer
computations, like exploring the Syracuse conjecture.


## Decimal numbers

Decimal numbers are used to represent values with a fractional part.
DB48X supports three decimal numbers, using the 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit
[binary decimal representation](#intel-decimal-floating-point-math).
In memory, all decimal numbers use one additional byte: a 32-bit decimal number
uses 5 bytes, a 128-bit binary decimal number uses 17 bytes.

The 32-bit format offers a 7 digits mantissa and has a maximum exponent
of 96. The 64-bit format offers a 16 digits mantissa and has a maximum
exponent of 384. The 128-bit format offers a 34 digits mantissa and a maximum
exponent of 6144.

The [Precision](#precision) command selects the default precision.

Note that a future implementation of DB48X is expected to feature
variable-precision decimal numbers similar to [newRPL](#newRPL-project).


## Based numbers

Based numbers are used to perform computations in any base. The most common
bases used in computer science, 2, 8, 10 and 16, have special shortcuts.
The [Bases Menu](#bases-menu) list operations on based numbers.

Like integers, based numbers can be [arbitrary large](#big-integers).
However, operations on based numbers can be truncated to a specific number of
bits using the [WordSize](#wordsize) setting. This makes it possible to perform
computations simulating a 16-bit or 256-bit processor.


## Boolean values

DB48X has two boolean values, `True` and `False`. These values are typically
returned by operations such as tests that return a truth value.

In addition, numerical values are interpreted as being `False` if the value is
0, and `True` otherwise. This applies to conditional tests, conditional loops,
and other operations that consume a truth value.

## Complex numbers

Complex numbers can be represented in rectangular form or polar form.
The rectangular form will show as something like `2+3ⅈ` on the display, where
`2` is the real part and `3` is the imaginary part. The polar form will show as
something like `1∡90°` on the display, where `1` is the modulus and `90°` is the
argument. The two forms can be mixed and matched in operations. The calculator
typically selects the most efficient form for a given operation.

Available operations on complex numbers include basic arithmetic, trigonometric,
logarithms, exponential and hyperbolic functions, as well as a few specific
functions such as [conj](#conj) or [arg](#arg). These functions are available in
the [Complex Menu](#complex-menu).


## Expressions

Algebraic expressions and equations are represented between quotes, for example
`X+1` or `A+B=C`. Many functions such as circular functions, exponential, logs
or hyperbolic functions can apply to algebraic expressions.

An expression that contains an equal sign, e.g. `sin X + 1 = cos X`, is called
an *equation*. It can be given as an argument to the solver.


## Lists

Lists are sequence of items between curly braces, such as `{ 1 'A' "Hello" }`.
They can contain an arbitrary number of elements, and can be nested.

Operations such as `sin` apply to all elements on a list.


## Vectors and matrices

Vector and matrices represent tables of numbers, and are represented between
square brackets, for example `[1 2 3]` for a vector and `[[1 2] [3 4]` for a 2x2
matrix.

Vector and matrices follow their own arithmetic rules. Vectors are
one-dimensional, matrices are two-dimensional. DB48X also supports tables with a
higher number of dimensions, but only offers limited operations on them.

DB48X implements vector addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
which apply component-wise. Multiplication and division are an extension
compared to the HP48.

DB48X also implements matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division. Like on the HP48, the division of matrix `A` by matrix `B` is
interpreted as left-multiplying `A` by the inverse of `B`.

As another extension, algebraic functions such as `sin` apply to all elements in
a vector or matrix in turn.


## Units

Unit objects represent values with an associated unit. They are represented
using the `_` operator, e.g. `1_km/s`, although on display this operator is
shown as a thin space, e.g. `1 km/s`.

Units as implemented in DB48X are modernized compared to what the HP48
implements, and differ from the HP RPL implementation in the following ways:

* Add [recent SI prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/owm/metric-si-prefixes),
  Z (zetta), Y (yotta), R (ronna) and Q (quetta) for large scale,
  z (zepto), y (yocto), r (ronto) and q (quecto) for small scale.

* Take into account the impact on unit conversions of the
  [revised 2023 definition of the foot](https://www.nist.gov/pml/us-surveyfoot/revised-unit-conversion-factors).

* Use exact (fraction-based) conversions wherever possible. This notably matters
  for the conversions of pre-2023 US Survey units, where the ratio is
  `1_ft = 1200/3937_m`, which is not well represented using decimal values.

* Add computer-related units, like the `byte`, the `bit`, the `baud`, as well
  as a menu supporting these units.

* In order to support the computer-related units better, also recognize the
  [power-of-two variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte),
  e.g. `1_kiB` is `1024_B`. Also recogize the `K` prefix in addition to `k`.

### Units file

The built-in units can be overriden by your own set of units, which is defined
in a CSV file called `config/units.csv` in the calculator. CSV stands for "Comma
separated values, and is a common interchange format for spreadsheet data.

Here is an example of file that would let you have a units menu called `Money`
to convert between various monetary units:

```
"Money"
"USD", "1_USD"
"EUR", "1.07_USD"
"GBP", "1.24_USD"
"CAD", "0.73_USD"
"AUD", "0.65_USD"
"CHF", "1.11_USD"
```

* All values must be placed between quotes. Separators between text values are
  mostly ignored.

* Rows in a file containing a single value denote unit menus, unless the value
  begins with an `=` sign.

* Rows in a file containing two ore more values denote unit menu entries, which
  will be added to the previous menu.

* The first column in these rows give the name of the unit as shown in the menu.

* The second column in these rows gives the definition of the unit.

* The definition should be reduced to `=` if the first column contains what
  would be a valid unit expression. For example, to place `km/h` in a menu, use
  `"km/h", "="` since `km` can be deduced from existing unit `m` using the
  standard "kilo" unit prefix, and `h` is an existing unit.

A unit where the value is `1` of the same unit is a base unit. This is the case
for `USD` in the example above, which is considered the base units for monetary
exchanges. Units that refer to the same base unit can be converted with one
another. For example, you can convert between `GBP` and `AUD` because they both
have the same `USD` base unit.

The commands `ShowBuiltinUnits` and `HideBuiltinUnits` indicate if the built-in
uits should be shown after the units loaded from the file. The default is that
when a units file is present, the built-in units are hidden. This only affects
the menus. Built-in units can always be used in expressions if they are typed
manually. However, units loaded from file will be looked up first, so that a
built-in unit can be overriden by the units file, which can be useful if a
definition changes like the US Survey foot changed on January 1st, 2023.

If you build a units file, it is recommended that you do not exceed 17 unit
submenus so that all unit categories fit on a single screen.


### Cycle command customization

The menu name `"=Cycle"` is reserved to define sequences of units that the
`Cycle` command (bound to the _EEX_ key) will recognize as special. For example,
you can ensure that `mm` and `in` convert to one another as follows:

```
"=Cycle"
"in", "mm"
"mm", "in"
"USD", "EUR"
"EUR", "CHF"
"CHF", "USD"
```

If you do provide a `Cycle` customization for a unit, other normal behaviours of
the `Cycle` command for units are disabled, notably conversion between various
relevant scales and conversion between fractions and decimal. To force a
particular conversion to happen in decimal, you can override the definition of
the corresponding unit in the units file, for example:

```
"in",   "25.4_mm"
```


## Constants

Constant objects represent named values like Euler's constant `e`, the ratio
between circumference and diameter of a circle `π`, or the speed of light `c`.
They are represented by a name, and have an associated value.

Like units, there are some built-in constants, and additional constants can be
provided by a `config/constants.csv` file, which has exactly the same format as
for the units file.
