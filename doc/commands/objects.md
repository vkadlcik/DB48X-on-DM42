# Objects

## Cycle

Cycle through various representations of the object on the first level of the stack.

* Polar <-> Rectangular for complex numbers
* Decimal <-> Fraction
* Integer <-> Based (cycles through the 2, 8, 10 and 16 base)
* Array <-> List <-> Program
* Text <-> Symbol

For unit objects, `Cycle` will cycle through all SI prefixes such that the
decimal representations fits within the `StandardExponent` range (i.e. that
would not display in scientific mode), increasing the numerical value, and then
switch the value to a fraction and cycle through all fraction representations
that fit within the same numerical range.

For example, if the `StandardExponent` is set to `6`, the value `0.1_m` will
cycle as follows:

* `0.1_m` being a decimal, we move to next scale up as decimal
* `1._dm`
* `10._cm`
* `100._mm`
* `100000._μm`, which is the limit of what can be displayed with 6 digits, so we
  switch to a fractional representation.
* `100000_μm` being a fraction, we go through the prefixes going down.
* `100_mm`
* `10_cm`
* `1_dm`
* `1/10_m`
* `1/100_dam`
* `1/1000_hm`
* `1/10000_km`, at which point the conversion would be out of range, so we
  switch back to decimal.
* `0.0001_km`
* `0.001_hm`
* `0.01_dam`
* `0.1_m` at which point the cycle repeats.


## Explode (OBJ→)

Explode an object into its sub-components. The various sub-components are placed
on the stack, and if necessary, information about the size is places on the
first level of the stack.

* Complex numbers are split into real and imaginary part (for rectangular form)
  or modulus and argument (for polar form). The latter is an extension compared
  to classical RPL, which always represent complex numbers in rectangular form.

* Unit objects are split into the value and unit expression. This is a deviation
  from standard RPL, which places a unit object on the first level of the stack.

* Lists, programs and expressions are split into their individual components,
  and the number of components is placed on the first level of the stack. For
  programs, this is an extension of standard RPL. For expressions, this is a
  deviation: HP calculators instead place only the top level object and
  the arity.

* Arrays and vectors are split into their individual components, and the number
  of elements is placed as a list on the first level of the stack. The dimension
  list has one element for vectors, and two for matrices. If a given matrix is
  not rectangular, then the command reports an `Invalid dimension` error.

* Text is evaluated as if it had been executed on the command line, in a way
  similar to the `STR→` command.
