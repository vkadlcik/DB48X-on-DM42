# Settings

The calculator has a number of user-configurable settings:

* [Display](#display-settings)
* [Angles](#angle-settings)
* [Command display](#command-display)
* [Decimal separator](#decimal-separator-settings)
* [Precision](#precision-settings)
* [Base](#base-settings)
* [User interface](#user-interface)

The current preferences can be retrieved and saved using the `Modes` command.

## Modes

Returns a program that will restore the current settings. This program can be saved into a variable to quickly restore a carefully crafted set of preferences. Note that the calculator automatically restores the mode when it [loads a state](#States).

# Display settings

The display mode controls how DB48X displays numbers. Regardless of the display
mode, numbers are always stored with full precision.

DB48X has five display mode (one more than the HP48)s:

* [Standard mode](#StandardDisplay)
* [Fixed mode](#FixedDisplay)
* [Scientific mode](#ScientificDisplay)
* [Engineering mode](#EngineeringDisplay))
* [Significant digits mode](#SignificantDisplay))

## StandardDisplay (STD)

Display numbers using full precision. All significant digts to the right of the
decimal separator are shown, up to 34 digits.

## FixedDisplay (FIX)

Display numbers rounded to a specific number of decimal places.

## ScientificDisplay (SCI)

Display numbers in scientific notation, i.e. with a mantissa and an
exponent. The mantissa has one digit to the left of the decimal separator and
shows the specified number of decimal places.

## EngineeringDisplay (SCI)

Display nunmbers as a mantissa with a sepcified number of digits, followed by an
exponent that is a multiple of 3.

## SignificantDisplay (SIG)

Display up to the given number of digits without trailing zero. This mode is
useful because DB48X can compute with large precision, and it may be useful to
not see all digits. `StndardDisplay` is equivalent to `34 SignificantDisplay`,
while `12 SignificantDisplay` should approximate the HP48 standard mode using
12 significant digits.

## StandardExponent

Select the maximum exponent before switching to scientific notation. The default value is 9, meaning that display uses scientific notation for exponents outside of -9..9.

## MinimumSignificantDigits

Select the minimum number of significant digits before switching to scientific notation in `FIX` mode.

The default value is 0, which is similar to how HP calculators before the HP Prime perform. For example, with `2 FIX`, the value `0.055` will display as `0.06`, and `0.0055` will display as `0.01`.

A higher value will switch to scienfic mode to show at least the given number of digits. For instance, with `2 FIX`, if the value is `1`, then `0.055` will still display as `0.06` but `0.0055` will display as `5.50E-3`. If the value is `2`, then `0.055` will display as `5.5E-2`. A setting of `1` correspond to what the HP Prime does.

A value of `-1` indicates that you do not want `FIX` mode to ever go to scientific notation for negative exponents. In that case, `0.00055` will display as `0.00`.


## TrailingDecimal

Display a trailing decimal separator to distinguish decimal from integer types. With this setting, `1.0` will display as `1.`. This can be disabled with [NoTrailingDecimal](#NoTrailingDecimal).


## NoTrailingDecimal

Hide the trailing decimal separator for decimal values with no fractional part. In that mode, `1.0` and `1` will both display identically, although the internal representation is different, the former being a floating-point value while the latter is an integer value.

## FancyExponent

Display the exponent in scientific mode using a fancy rendering that is visually similar to the normal mathematical notation.

## ClassicExponent

Display the exponent in scientific mode in a way reminiscent of classical HP48 calculators, for example `1.23E-4`.

## MixedFractions

Display fractions as mixed fractions when necessary, e.g. `3/2` will show up as `1 1/2`.

## ImproperFractions

Display fractions as improper fractions, e.g. `3/2` will show up as `3/2` and not `1 1/2`.

## SmallFractions

Show fractions using smaller characters, for example `¹²/₄₃`

## BigFractions

Show fractions using regular characters, for example `12/43`

# Angle settings

The angle mode determines how the calculator interprets angle arguments and how
it returns angle results.

DB48X has four angle modes:

* [Degrees](#Degrees): A full circle is 360 degress
* [Radians](#Radians): A full circle is 2π radians
* [Grads](#Grads): A full circle is 400 radians
* [PiRadians](#PiRadians): Radians shown as multiple of π

## Degrees (DEG)

Select degrees as the angular unit. A full circle is 360 degrees.

## Radians (RAD)

Select radians as the angular unit. A full circle is 2π radians,
and the angle is shown as a numerical value.

## Grads (GRAD)

Select grads as the angular unit. A full circle is 400 grads.

## PiRadians (PIRAD)

Select multiples of π as the angular unit. A full circle is 2π radians,
shown as a multiple of π.


# Command display

DB48X can display commands either using a short legacy spelling, usually
identical to what is used on the HP-48 series of calculators, or use an
alternative longer spelling. For example, the command to store a value in a
variable is called `STO` in the HP-48, and can also be spelled `Store` in DB48X.

Commands are case insensitive, and all spellings are accepted as input
irrespective of the display mode.

DB48X has four command spelling modes:

* [Lowercase](#LowerCase): Display `sto`
* [Uppercase](#UpperCase): Display `STO`
* [Capitalized](#Capitalized): Display `Sto`
* [LongForm](#LongForm): Display `Store`

There are four parallel settings for displaying a variable name such as `varName`:

* [LowercaseNames](#LowerCaseNames): Display as `varname`
* [UppercaseNames](#UpperCaseNames): Display as `VARNAME`
* [CapitalizedNames](#CapitalizedNames): Display as `VarName`
* [LongFormNames](#LongFormNames): Display as `varName`


## LowerCase

Display comands using the short form in lower case, for example `sto`.

## UpperCase

Display comands using the short form in upper case, for example `STO`.

## Capitalized

Display comands using the short form capitalized, for example `Sto`.

## LongForm

Display comands using the long form, for example `Store`.

## LowerCaseNames

Display names using the short form in lower case, for example `varName` will show as `varname`.

## UpperCase

Display names using the short form in upper case, for example `varName` will show as `VARNAME`.

## Capitalized

Display names using the short form capitalized, for example `varName` will show as `VarName`.

## LongForm

Display names using the long form, for example `varName` will show as `varName`.

# Decimal separator settings

The decimal separator can be either a dot (`1.23`) or a comma (`1,23`).

## DecimalDot

Select the dot as a decimal separator, e.g.  `1.23`

## DecimalComma

Select the comma as a decimal separator, e.g.  `1,23`

# Precision settings

## Precision

Set the default computation precision, given as a number of decimal digits. For
example, `7 Precision` will ensure at least 7 decimal digits for compuation, and
`1.0 3 /` will compute `0.3333333` in that case.

DB48X supports an arbitrary precision for decimal numbers, limited only by
memory and the size of built-in constants needed for the computation of
transcendental functions.


# Base settings

Integer values can be reprecended in a number of different bases:

* [Binary](#Binary) is base 2
* [Ocgtal](#Octal) is base 8
* [Decimal](#Decimal) is base 10
* [Hexadecimal](#Hexadecimal) is base 16

## Binary (BIN)

Selects base 2

## Octal (OCT)

Selects base 8

## Decimal (DEC)

Selects base 10

## Hexadecimal (HEX)

Selects base 16

## Base

Select an arbitrary base for computations

## WordSize (STWS)

Store the current [word size](#wordsize) in bits. The word size is used for
operations on based numbers. The value must be greater than 1, and the number of
bits is limited only by memory and performance.

## RecallWordSize (RCWS)

Return the current [word size](#wordsize) in bits.

## STWS

`STWS` is a compatibility spelling for the [WordSize](#wordsize) command.

## RCWS

`RCWS` is a compatibility spelling for the [RecallWordSize](#recallwordsize)
command.

## MaxRewrites

Defines the maximum number of rewrites in an equation.

[Equations rewrites](#rewrite) can go into infinite loops, e.g. `'X+Y' 'A+B'
'B+A' rewrite` can never end, since it keeps rewriting terms. This setting
indicates how many attempts at rewriting will be done before erroring out.

## MaxNumberBits

Define the maxmimum number of bits for numbers.

Large integer operations can take a very long time, notably when displaying them
on the stack. With the default value of 1024 bits, you can compute `100!` but
computing `200!` will result in an error, `Number is too big`. You can however
compute it seting a higher value for `MaxNumberBits`, for example
`2048 MaxNumberBits`.

This setting applies to integer components in a number. In other words, it
applies separately for the numerator and denominator in a fraction, or for the
real and imaginary part in a complex number. A complex number made of two
fractions can therefore take up to four times the number of bits specified by
this setting.

## ToFractionIterations (→QIterations, →FracIterations)

Define the maximum number of iterations converting a decimal value to a
fraction. For example, `1 →FracIterations 3.1415926 →Frac` will give `22/7`,
whereas `3 →FracIterations 3.1415926 →Frac` will give `355/113`.

## ToFractionDigits (→QDigits, →FracDigits)

Define the maximum number of digits of precision converting a decimal value to a
fraction. For example, `2 →FracDigits 3.1415926 →Frac` will give `355/113`.


# User interface

Various user-interface aspects can be customized, including the appearance of
Soft-key menus. Menus can show on one or three rows, with 18 (shifted) or 6
(flat) functions per page, and there are two possible visual themes for the
labels, rounded or square.

## ThreeRowsMenus

Display menus on up to three rows, with shift and double-shift functions showns
above the primary menu function.

## SingleRowMenus

Display menus on a single row, with labels changing using shift.

## FlatMenus

Display menus on a single row, flattened across multiple pages.

## RoundedMenu

Display menus using rounded black or white tabs.

## SquareMenus

Display menus using square white tabs.

## CursorBlinkRate

Set the cursor blink rate in millisecond, between 50ms (20 blinks per second)
and 5000ms (blinking every 5 seconds).

## ShowBuiltinUnits

Show built-in units in the `UnitsMenu` even when a units file was loaded.

## HideBuiltinUnits

Hide built-in units in the `UnitsMenu` when a units file was loaded.
The built-in units will still show up if the units file fails to load.

## LinearFitSums

When this setting is active, statistics functions that return sums, such as
`ΣXY` or `ΣX²`, operate without any adjustment to the data, i.e. as if the
fitting model in `ΣParameters` was `LinearFit`.

## CurrentFitSums

When this setting is active, statistics functions that return sums, such as
`ΣXY` or `ΣX²`, will adjust their input according to the current fitting model
in special variable `ΣParameters`, in the same way as required for
`LinearRegression`.

## DetailedTypes

The `Type` command returns detailed DB48X type values, which can distinguish
between all DB48X object types, e.g. distinguish between polar and rectangular
objects, or the three internal representations for decimal numbers. Returned
values are all negative, which distinguishes them from RPL standard values, and
makes it possible to write code that accepts both the compatible and detailed
values.

This is the opposite of [CompatibleTypes](#compatibletypes).

## CompatibleTypes

The `Type` command returns values as close to possible to the values documented
on page 3-262 of the HP50G advanced reference manual. This is the opposite of
[NativeTypes](#nativetypes).


## MultiLineResult

Show the result (level 1 of the stack) using multiple lines.
This is the opposite of [SingleLineResult](#singlelineresult).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [MultiLineStack](#multilinestack)

## SingleLineResult

Show the result (level 1 of the stack) on a single line.
This is the opposite of [MultiLineResult](#multilineresult).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [SingleLineStack](#singlelinestack)

## MultiLineStack

Show the levels of the stack after the first one using multiple lines.
This is the opposite of [SingleLineStack](#singlelinestack).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [MultiLineResult](#multilineresult)

## SingleLineStack

Show the levels of the stack after the first one on a single line
This is the opposite of [MultiLineStack](#multilinestack).
Other levels of the stack are controled by [SingleLineResult](#singlelineresult)


# States

The calculator can save and restore state in files with extension `.48S`.
This feature is available through the `Setup` menu (Shift-`0`).

The following information is stored in state files:

* Global variables
* Stack contents
* Settings
