# Menus

Menus display at the bottom of the screen, and can be activated using the keys
on the top row of the calculator. Menus can refer to other menus. The calculator
keeps a history of the menus you visited previously, and you can return to an
earlier menu with the `BackMenu` function.


Here are the main menus in DB48X, in alphabetical order.

## MainMenu

The *Main menu* gives access to _all_ the functions in your calculator, sorted
by cathegory. It includes the following submenus:

* [Math](#MathMenu): Mathematical operations
* [Symb](#SymbolicMenu): Symbolic operations
* [Units](#UnitsMenu): Unit conversions
* [System](#SystemMenu): System configuration
* [Prog](#ProggramMenu): Programming
* [Vars](#VariablesMenu): User variables


## MathMenu

The *Math menu* gives access to mathematical functions like [SIN](#sin) in your
calculator. It includes the following submenus:

* [Arith](#ArithmeticMenu): Arithmetic functions
* [Base](#BaseMenu): Based numbers
* [Trans](#TranscendentalMenu): Transcendental functions
* [Stats](#StatisticsMenu): Statistics
* [Lists](#ListsMenu): List operations
* [Matrix](#MatrixMenu): Matrices and vectors
* [Solve](#SolverMenu): Numerical solver


## VariablesMenu (VARS)

The variables menu displays the variables in the current directory.
It is a three row menu, where for each variable:

* The primary function [evaluates the variable](#VariablesMenuExecute)
* The first shifted function [recalls the variable](#VariablesMenuRecall)
* The second shifted function [stores in the variable](#VariablesMenuStore)

## VariablesMenuExecute

Hitting the primary function in the [Vars menu](#VariablesMenu) evaluates the
corresponding variable.

## VariablesMenuRecall

Hitting the first shifted function in the [Vars menu](#VariablesMenu) will
[recall](#Recall) the corresponding variable on the stack.

## VariablesMenuStore

Hitting the second shifted function in the [Vars menu](#VariablesMenu) will
[store](#Store) the top of stack in the corresponding variable.


## ToolsMenu

The `ToolsMenu` maps to the _A_ key (_Σ+_ on the original DM42 keyboard).
It invokes a context-dependent menu adapted to the top level of the stack.


## LastMenu

The `LastMenu` function, which is the shifted function for the _ A _ key,
returns back in the history of past visited menus.
