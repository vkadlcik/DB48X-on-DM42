# Debugging

DB48X offers a variety of capabilities to help debugging RPL programs. These are
made available through the [DebugMenu](#debugmenu), which is the menu that
[ToolsMenu](#toolsmenu) selects when a program is on the stack.


## DebugMenu

The debug menu contains operations necessary to debug RPL programs:

* [Debug](#debug)
* [Step](#singlestep)
* [Over](#stepover)
* [Steps](#multiplesteps)
* [Continue](#continue)
* [Halt](#halt)
* [Kill](#kill)
* [Step↑](#stepout)


## Debug (DBUG)

The `Debug` command takes a program or expression as an argument, and starts
debugging execution of it. When a program is halted for debugging, the header
area shows a _♦_ symbol, and the next instruction to be executed is shown above
the stack. When a program is single-stepping, the header area shows a _›_
symbol.

While a program is being debugged, you can use the command line normally and
even execute programs from it. However, only a single debugging session can
exist. If the program being executed halts, e.g. through the `HALT` command or
by being interrupted using the _EXIT_ key, then this is seen as part of the same
debugging session.


## SingleStep (SST)

The `SingleStep` command steps through a single instruction in the RPL program.


## StepOver

The `StepOver` command steps over the next instruction. If the next instruction
is a variable name containing a program, execution halts after executing the
program. If the next instruction being shown is a sequence of instructions, for
example the test or the sequence of instructions in tests or loops, then the
entire sequence is evaluated at once.

## StepOut

The `StepOut` command steps out of the current code block.

## MultipleSteps

The `MultipleSteps` instruction evaluates an arbitrary number of steps in the
program being debugged. The number of steps to execute is passed as an argument
in the first level of the stack. For example, `40 MultipleSteps` will execute
the next 40 RPL instructions.

## Continue (CONT)

The `Continue` command resumes execution of the current RPL program at the
current instruction.

## Halt

The `Halt` instruction interrupts the execution of a program, making it possible
to insert breakpoints at specific locations in a program.

## Kill

The `Kill` instruction stops the execution of the program currently being
debugged.
