# Statistics

## RDZ
Initialize random number generator with a seed


## RAND
Generate a random real number

## ΣData (ΣDAT)

The `ΣData` variable contains the statistics data, in the form of a matrix.

*Note*: The `ΣData` name is considered a command internally, and as such,
is subject to `CommandDisplayMode` and not `NamesDisplayMode`.

## ΣParameters (ΣPAR)

The `ΣParameters` variable contains the statistics parameters, as a list with
five elements:

`{ xcol ycol intercept slope fit }`

The `xcol` value is an integer starting at 1, indicating the independent column.
The `ycol` value similarly indicates the dependent column.

The `intercept` and `slope` are the parameters for the linear regression.
The `fit` value is the type of fit being used:
(`LinFit`, `ExpFit`, `PwrFit`, `LogFit`);

*Note*: The `ΣParameters` name is considered a command internally, and as such,
is subject to `CommandDisplayMode` and not `NamesDisplayMode`.

## Σ+

Add data to the statistics data array `ΣData`.

* If data is a real or complex number, statistics data is single-column

* If data is a vector, statistics data has the same number of columns as the
  size of the vector.

## Σ-

Remove the last data entered in the statistics array, and pushes it on the stack.

## RecallΣ (RCLΣ)

Recall statistics data and puts it on the stack

## StoreΣ (STOΣ)

Stores an array from the stack as statistics data in the `ΣData` variable.

## ClearΣ (CLΣ)

Clear statistics data.

## Average (MEAN, AVG)

Compute the average (mean) of the values in the statistics data.
If there is a single column of data, the result is a real number.
Otherwise, it is a vector for each column of data.

## Median

Compute the median of the values in the statistics data array `ΣData`.

## MinΣ

Compute the smallest of the values in the statistics data array `ΣData`.

## MaxΣ

Compute the largest of the values in the statistics data array `ΣData`.

## ΣSize (NΣ)

Return the number of data rows in the statistics data array `ΣData`.

## ΣX

Return the sum of values in the `XCol` column of the statistics data array
`ΣData`. The values are adjusted according to the current fitting model defined
in `ΣParameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is active.

## ΣY

Return the sum of values in the `YCol` column of the statistics data array
`ΣData`. The values are adjusted according to the current fitting model defined
in `ΣParameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is active.

## ΣXY

Return the sum of the product of values in the `XCol` and `YCol` columns of the
statistics data array `ΣData`. The values are adjusted according to the current
fitting model defined in `ΣParameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is
active.

## ΣX²

Return the sum of the squares of the values in the `XCol` column of the
statistics data array `ΣData`. The values are adjusted according to the current
fitting model defined in `ΣParameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is
active.

## ΣY²

Return the sum of the squares of the values in the `YCol` column of the
statistics data array `ΣData`. The values are adjusted according to the current
fitting model defined in `ΣParameters` if the `CurrentFitSums` setting is
active.

## Total (TOT)

Returns the sum of all columns in the statistics data array `ΣData`.

## Variance (VAR)

Calculates the sample variance of the coordinate values in each of the columns
in the current statistics matrix (`ΣData`).

## Correlation (CORR)

Returns the correlation coefficient of the independent and dependent data
columns in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `ΣData`).

The columns are specified by the first two elements in the reserved variable
`ΣParameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol`, respectively. If `ΣParameters` does not
exist, `Correlation` creates it and sets the elements to their default values
(1 and 2).

## Covariance (COV)

Returns the sample covariance of the independent and dependent data columns in
the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `ΣData`).

The columns are specified by the first two elements in the reserved variable
`ΣParameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol`, respectively. If `ΣParameters` does not
exist, `Correlation` creates it and sets the elements to their default values
(1 and 2).

## StandardDeviation (SDEV)

Calculates the sample standard deviation of each of the columns of coordinate values in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `ΣData`).

`StandardDeviation`  returns a vector of numbers, or a single number there is only one column of data.

The standard deviation is the square root of the `Variance`.

## LinearRegression (LR)

Uses the currently selected statistical model to calculate the linear regression
coefficients (intercept and slope) for the selected dependent and independent
variables in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `ΣData`).

The columns of independent and dependent data are specified by the first two
elements in the reserved variable `ΣParameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol`, respectively.
The default independent and dependent columns are 1 and 2.

The selected statistical model is the fifth element in `ΣParameters`.
LR stores the intercept and slope (untagged) as the third and fourth elements,
respectively, in `ΣParameters`.

The coefficients of the exponential (`ExpFit`), logarithmic (`LogFit`),
and power (`PwrFit`) models are calculated using transformations that allow
the data to be fitted by standard linear regression.

The equations for these transformations are:

* `LinFit`: `y = slope * x + intercept`
* `LogFit`: `y = slope * ln(x) + intercept`
* `ExpFit`: `y = intercept * exp(slope * x)`
* `PwrFit`: `y = intercept * x ^ slope`

where b is the intercept and m is the slope. The logarithmic model requires
positive x-values (XCOL), the exponential model requires positive y-values
(YCOL), and the power model requires positive x- and y-values.

## Intercept

Return the intercept value last computed by `LinearRegression`

This is a DB48X extension, not present on HP calculators

## Slope

Return the slope value last computed by `LinearRegression`

This is a DB48X extension, not present on HP calculators

## BestFit

Select the best linear regression mode based on current data, i.e. the
regression mode where the correlation value is the highest.

## LinearFit (LINFIT)

Select linear fit, i.e. try to model data with a linear equation `y = a*x+b`.

## ExponentialFit (EXPFIT)

Select exponential fit, i.e. try to model data with an equation `y = b*exp(a*x)`

## LogarithmicFit (LOGFIT)

Select logarithmic fit, i.e. try to model data with an equation `y = a*ln(x)+b`.

## PowerFit (PWRFIT)

Select power fit, i.e. try to model data with an equation `y = x^a * b`.


## FrequencyBins (BINS)

Sorts the elements of the independent column (`XCol`) of the current statistics
matrix (the reserved variable `ΣDat`) into (`nbins + 2`) bins, where the left
edge of bin 1 starts at value `xmin` and each bin has width `xwidth`.

`FrequencyBins` returns a matrix containing the frequency of occurrences in each
bin, and a 2-element array containing the frequency of occurrences falling below
or above the defined range of x-values. The array can be stored into the
reserved variable `ΣData` and used to plot a bar histogram of the bin data, for
example, by executing `BarPlot`.

`xmin` `xwidth` `nbins` ▶ `[[ n1 .. n2 ]]` `[ nlow nhigh ]`


## PopulationVariance (PVAR)

Calculates the population variance of the coordinate values in each of the m
columns in the current statistics matrix (`ΣData`).

The population variance (equal to the square of the population standard
deviation) is returned as a vector of m real numbers, or as a single real number
if there is a single column of data.

## PopulationStandardDeviation (PSDEV)

Calculates the population standard deviation of each of the m columns of
coordinate values in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `ΣData`).

The command returns a vector of m real numbers, or a single real number if there
is a single column of data.

## PopulationCovariance (PCOV)

Computes the population covariance of the independent and dependent data columns
in the current statistics matrix (reserved variable `ΣData`).

The columns are specified by the first two elements in reserved variable
`ΣParameters`, set by `XCol` and `YCol` respectively. If `ΣParameters` does not
exist, `PCOV` creates it and sets the elements to their default values, 1 and 2.
