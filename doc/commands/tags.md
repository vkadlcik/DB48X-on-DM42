# Tagged objects

Tagged objects are a way to indicate what a value represents, using a *tag*
between colons and preceding the object. For example, `:X:3` is a tagged
integer, where the tag is `X` and the object is `3`.

When displayed on the stack, tags are shown without the leading colon for
readability. For example, the object above shows as `X:3` on the stack.

## →Tag (ToTag)

Apply a tag to an object. The tag is in level 1 as text or name. The object to
be tagged is in level 2. For example, `"Hello" 1 →Tag` results in `:Hello:1`.
Like on the HP calculators, it is possible to next tags.

## Tag→ (FromTag)

Expand a tagged object in level 1 into its object and tag. The object will be in
level 2, the tag will be in level 1 as a text object.

For example, `:Hello:1 Tag→` results in `"Hello"` in level 1 and `1` in level 2.

## DeleteTag (DTAG)

Remove a tag from an object. For example, `:Hello:1 DeleteTag` results in `1`.
If there is no tag, the object is returned as is.
